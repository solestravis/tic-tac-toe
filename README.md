# Tic Tac Toe React Challenge

## Excercise

Code a tic tac toe game, where the user alternates playing as two different players: "X" and "O". 

On the screen, there should be an indication of which player will go the next turn, who the winner is once the game is over, and a button to reset the game back to the beginning.

Keep in mind the three possible combinations to win this game: 3 Xs or Os, in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line.

## Running this code in your local machine
First, run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and head over to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game.

Coded using React and JavaScript. Styles using SCSS modules.
